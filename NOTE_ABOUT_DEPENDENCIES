Before you compile with make these programs, you
have to create the Makefile.Dependencies file, where
the dependencies between source files are stored.

In order to do this, you have to:

1. At /source/Makefile comment out line: "include $(DEPENDENCIES_FILE)"

2. Run: cd /source; make depend

3. Remove the comments you've put in 1.
